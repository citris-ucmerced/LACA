							<p>
								California is the fifth largest economy in the world, a global leader in technology, and
								the nation’s most agriculturally diverse and productive state, and yet its food system
								is vulnerable to climate change, regulatory change, water availability, and unexpected
								events such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic.  The Labor and Automation in California
								Agriculture or LACA team is an interdisciplinary group spanning 4 UC campuses and UC
								Agriculture & Natural Resources (ANR) that strives to create a new model for
								agricultural technology. By partnering with farmers, workers, and agriculturists, LACA
								hopes to create a model that supports farmers and workers, while enhancing productivity
								and environmental sustainability.

								LACA is divided into 4 research thrusts, AgTech, Labor impact, Environmental impact,
								and Underlying and emerging problems.
							</p>
							<section class="box feature">
								<h2><a href="#">AgTech</a></h2>
								<p style="font-size: large;">
									&emsp;Developing and testing novel AgTech systems, specifically 3 types of
									stationary and robotic systems:
								<ul style="text-align: left;">
									<li>An irrigation system which incorporates water resource management</li>

									<li>A scalable robotcis design and prototype that can accurately assess and identify
										disease and pests while supporting environmental decision-making on fertilizer
										and pesticide application</li>

									<li>An autonomous decision-making system that
										can support agricultural task assignment decisions. </li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<!-- <ul style="text-align: left;">
									<li>A multi-modal irrigation participatory design case study and prototype with
										links to water resource management and assessments of economic and labor
										implications.</li>

									<li>A scalable robotics participatory design case study and prototype that can
										offer accurate, on-demand identification of disease or its precursors while
										supporting environmental decision-making (e.g. fertilizer and pesticide
										application), and assessments of economic and labor implications.</li>

									<li>An autonomous decision-making system design case study and prototype that
										can support agricultural task assignment decisions with on-demand
										information. </li>
								</ul> -->
							</section>
							<section class="box feature">
								<h2><a href="#">Labor Impact</a></h2>
								<p>
									The aim of this thrust is to understand AgTech adoption by farmers, the impact
									of <br>adoption on farm labor, and the greater effect of the AgTech-Labor model on
									the California labor market. 

								</p>
							</section>
							<section class="box post">
								<h2><a href="#">Environmental impact</a></h2>
								<p>
									Our aim is to integrate environmental sustainability scaffolding into our
									AgTech-Labor model to <br> enhance agrifood system resilience by protecting and
									regenerating soil, air, water, and agroecoystems in perpetuity.
								</p>

							</section>
							<section class="box post">
								<h2><a href="#">Underlying and emerging problems</a></h2>
								<p style="text-align: left;">
									&emsp;As we collaboratively design the AgTech-Labor model, we anticipate the
									emergence
									of important issues implicating
									existing policy questions and debates. How these questions are framed and
									resolved will substantially influence the
									pace and character of the adoption of AgTech and its transformative effects for
									California’s agricultural, labor, and
									environmental sectors.

										<h2><a href="#">k-12</a></h2>
										<p>
											LACA will offer day camps for middle school students. The  day  camps  will 
											include  STEM 
											activities  (based  on the CITRIS Robotics curriculum) and will be
											coordinated by the LACA
											Education Director in collaboration with a  non-profit educational outreach
											organization
											<a href="https://www.4venir.org/">4Venir.org</a>, founded by UCM graduate
											students for
											children of migrant workers.
										</p>
										<h2><a href="#">LACA undergraduate student opportunities</a></h2>
										<ul style="text-align: left;">
											<li>
												<b>First year seminars:</b> LACA faculty will provide seminars to first
												year college students on
												resilient and equitable food systems with intercampus and extramural
												guest appearances.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Undergraduate research experiences:</b> LACA will coordinate academic
												year and summer paid internships
												spanning LACA research and partner practitioners in AgTech, labor, and
												environmental areas.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Community  College  Bridge  Program:</b> LACA will partner on a newly
												fundedUSDA Research and Extension
												Experiences for Undergraduates (REEU) in 2020 entitled San Joaquin
												Valley Food and Agriculture Cyberinformatics Tools and Science (FACTS)
												Bridge

											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Cross-Campus General Education Course:</b> An upper division general
												education course on LACA and food systems. The course will be offered
												remotely during a 10-week quarter to accommodate all campuses, with a
												segment scheduled for the UC spring break period to allow for a 3-day
												field trip to farm facilities in the San Joaquin Valley.

								The LACA AgTech-Labor model will launch California farms
								to the forefront of resiliency and equity and empower a next generation labor force that
								understands and
								operates at the convergence of agricultural productivity, labor equity, and
								environmental sustainability.
