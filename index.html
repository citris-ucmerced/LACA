								<!-- California is the fifth largest economy in the world, a global leader in technology, and
								the nation’s most agriculturally diverse and productive state, and yet its food system
								is vulnerable to climate change, regulatory change, water availability, and unexpected
								events such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic.  The Labor and Automation in California
								Agriculture or LACA team is an interdisciplinary group spanning 4 UC campuses and UC
								Agriculture & Natural Resources (ANR) that strives to create a new model for
								agricultural technology. By partnering with farmers, workers, and agriculturists, LACA
								hopes to create a model that supports farmers and workers, while enhancing productivity
								and environmental sustainability. -->
								Funded in 2021 by the University of California Office of the President Multi-Campus
								Research Program Initiative, the Labor and Automation in California Agriculture (LACA)
								assembles interdisciplinary researchers to solve food system resilience and
								human-centered agriculture technology to transform the workforce and environment of the
								future. This MRPI includes researchers from University of California Mercerd, Berkeley,
								Davis, and Riverside.

							The LACA team is focused on four research thrusts:


							<ul>
								<li>
									AgTech: developing cutting-edge technology systems to monitor and manage resources
									and applications
								</li>
								<li>
									Labor Impacts: engaging socio-economic factors for incorporation of new technologies
								</li>
								<li>
									Environmental Impacts: create an agricultural model that incorporates data from
									AgTech for more sustainable farming practices
								</li>
								<li>
									Underlying and Emerging Problems: deals with policy and labor related issues that
									may arise during the course of the LACA research
								</li>

								<h4>AgTech</h4>
								<img style=width:100%; class="image" src="images/agplant.jpg" alt="" />
								<br>
								<br>
								<div>
									The AgTech thrust involves developing and testing novel Agricultural technology
									systems, specifically 3 types of stationary and robotic systems:
									<ul>
										<li><b>Multi-modal Precision Irrigation:</b> An irrigation system which
											incorporates water resource management</li>

										<li><b>Remote Sample Acquisition and Analysis:</b> A scalable robotics design
											and prototype that can accurately assess and
											identify disease and pests while supporting environmental decision-making on
											fertilizer and pesticide application</li>

										<li><b>Decision Making for Shared Autonomy in the Field:</b> An autonomous
											decision-making system that
											can support agricultural task assignment decisions. </li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								<!-- <ul style="text-align: left;">
									<li>A multi-modal irrigation participatory design case study and prototype with
										links to water resource management and assessments of economic and labor
										implications.</li>

									<li>A scalable robotics participatory design case study and prototype that can
										offer accurate, on-demand identification of disease or its precursors while
										supporting environmental decision-making (e.g. fertilizer and pesticide
										application), and assessments of economic and labor implications.</li>

									<li>An autonomous decision-making system design case study and prototype that
										can support agricultural task assignment decisions with on-demand
										information. </li>

									<img style="width:75%;" class="image" src="images/banners/tractor.jpg" alt="" />
								</div>
								<br>
								<br>
								<div>
									The aim of this thrust is to understand AgTech adoption by farmers, the impact
									of adoption on farm labor, and the greater effect of the AgTech-Labor model on
									the California labor market.
									<ul>
										<li><b>AgTech Adoption:</b> Synthesize AgTech adoption criteria into best
											practices for
											laborers, farmers and AgTech developers by characterizing AgTech adoption
											barriers and conducting research interviews with farmers.</li>

										<li><b>Impacts on Labor:</b> We will produce three inductive qualitative case
											studies
											on the adoption of the digital technologies in three crops or animal
											production. These case studies will be based upon semi-structured
											interviews, participant observation, and participatory research methods.
										</li>

										<li><b>Labor Markets:</b> Develop a better quantitative and qualitative
											understanding
											of the emerging AgTech labor market.</li>
									</ul>

									Our aim is to integrate environmental sustainability scaffolding into our
									AgTech-Labor model to enhance agrifood system resilience by protecting and
									regenerating soil, air, water, and agroecoystems in perpetuity.

									<ul>
										<li><b>Water Resources Management:</b> Tools for transforming irrigation data
											to inform the net farm water use, salinity changes and
											storage, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and assessments of
											economic and labor implications.</li>

										<li><b>Soil Fertility and Regenerative Agriculture:</b> AgTech-Environmental
											tools to
											monitor and sample for carbon and inform soil regeneration strategies.</li>

										<li><b>Biodiversity in Agricultural Landscapes:</b> AgTech-Environmental tools
											to integrate aerial and ground-based imagery, acoustic, and
											physical-chemical
											data to assess biodiversity and crop health.</li>

								<h4>Underlying and emerging problems</h4>
								<div>
									As we collaboratively design the AgTech-Labor model, we anticipate the
									emergence of important issues implicating existing policy questions and debates. How
									these questions are framed and
									resolved will substantially influence the pace and character of the adoption of
									AgTech and its transformative effects for
									California’s agricultural, labor, and environmental sectors.
